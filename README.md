# Sepiarize Sublime Text Theme

An easy-on-the-eye Sublimetext syntax theme inspired by Google Pocket's sepia reading theme. Always find it so easy on my eye however long an article is. Encourages me a lot too.

Goes well with [Material Theme(preferrable Darker version)](http://equinusocio.github.io/material-theme/)

### How to install

1. Open SublimeText
2. Open Preference -> Browse Packages (a folder explorer will open)
3. Git clone this repo
4. YOU ARE DONE.

__Enjoy the Theme__
